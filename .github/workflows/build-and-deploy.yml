# This workflow is no longer needed when using CodeBuild webhook integration
# CodeBuild will be triggered directly by GitHub webhooks
# 
# To set up webhook integration:
# 1. In AWS CodeBuild console, configure your project source as GitHub
# 2. Connect your GitHub account via OAuth or use a Personal Access Token
# 3. Enable webhook triggers in CodeBuild project settings
# 4. CodeBuild will automatically trigger on push events
